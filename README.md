# Python-Scrapers
Individual scrapers for sites primarily focusing on Cybersecurity sites/blogs, there are plenty of sites that already cater to this, but its always good to get your own resources and build your own collection. All code will be ran in a Jupyter notebook, but can easily be transferred over to .py files.

## Scrapers (currently)
- Mandiant
- Kaspersky
- Crowdstrike
- Cisco Talos
- Nviso Labs
- Synacktiv
- Elastic Security Labs

### Usage
```python <scraper_name>.py```
